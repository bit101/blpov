`blpov` is [bitlib](https://github.com/bit101/bitlib) for POV-Ray.

It also includes 3d functions from [wire](https://github.com/bit101/wire).

This currently includes:

- blgeom: macros for creating and manipulating 3d shapes and vectors.
- blrand: random functions, including generating random points in various configurations, such as on the surface or inside shapes.
- blmath: useful math utils.

Some of the functionality builds on standard POV libraries, while some functions reimplement standard lib functionality, either through ignorance that such a function exists, or a desire to have it work somewhat differently.

I'm creating this for personal use. Feel free to use it or learn from it, but at your own risk and with no promise of support or maintenance.
